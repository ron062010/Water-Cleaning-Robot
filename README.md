# Water-Cleaning-Robot
Water pollution is a global problem that affects not only human health but also the environment and wildlife. For example, in some parts of the world, water pollution has led to the death of fish, birds, and other aquatic animals, and it has destroyed their habitats. It has also led to the closure of beaches, affecting the tourism industry. The impact of water pollution on human health is significant.
As a solution to this problem, we have devised a method that employs a remote-controlled system to remove all the waste from bodies of water. A waste collection robot is designed with four modules: control, propulsion, collection, and deposit systems. The control module is responsible for controlling the robot's movements, while the propulsion module provides the necessary power to move the robot forward. The collection system is designed to collect the waste from the water, and the deposit system is responsible for depositing the waste in a container.
